# Python Image Destroyer

Python script containing functions to append and maliciously destroy images in various ways.

### Usage
---
Provide an image as an input when run and specify which function you want operated on the image by calling it before the last three lines of the script.

If you wish to put the output of one function into the input of another, you must call `prepare_reiterate()` before the next function is called.
